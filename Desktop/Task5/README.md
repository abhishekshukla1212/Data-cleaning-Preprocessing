# Decision Tree & Random Forest Classification on Car Dataset

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers on a car dataset.  
It includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Decision tree visualization
- Overfitting analysis
- Feature importance ranking
- Cross-validation

##  Dataset
The dataset contains various features about cars, including:
- Car prices
- Specifications
- Fuel types (target variable in this example)

## Results
Decision Tree accuracy vs Random Forest
Visualization of decision tree
Feature importance chart
Cross-validation comparison

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
